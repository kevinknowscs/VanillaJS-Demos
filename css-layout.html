          <p>
            You can always use the standard <code>display</code> properties to layout elements using the
            standard document flow.

            <tr>
              <td><code>display: inline-block;</code></td>
              <td>
                Displays the element as an inline-level block container. The inside of this block is
                formatted as a block-level box, and the element itself is formatted as an inline-level box.

      <tr>
        <td>Box Model Properties</td>
        <td>
          To tweak the flow of your elements, you can use the CSS Box Model properties, namely, margins, borders,
          and padding.
        </td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Block Width &amp; Height</td>
        <td>
          You can get clever with a div's height and width, including, in some cases, using percentage units
          to fill the available space. Note that height and width do not apply to inline elements.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CSS calc()</td>
        <td>
          Before the advent of Flexbox, the CSS3 calc() function can be handy to use in combination with
          percentage-based widths and heights. For example, you can set a top navigation pane to 50px height,
          then set the bottom, resizable pane height to &quot;calc(100%-50px)&quot;.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Floats</td>
        <td>
          Originally for floating images inside of blocks of text, the <code>float</code> property has become
          one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on web pages.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Positioning</td>
        <td>
          <p>
            Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave
            differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside
            the browser viewport.
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Position Value</th>
              <th>Description</th>              
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>position:&nbsp;static;</code></td>
              <td>
                The default position of every element. It means <q>put the element in it's normal position in the
                document layout flow.</q>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>position:&nbsp;relative;</code></td>
              <td>
                Once the positioned element has taken its place in the normal layout flow, you can then
                modify its final position (using the CSS properties <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>,
                and <code>right</code>).
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>position:&nbsp;absolute;</code></td>
              <td>
                An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. It sits on it's own layer,
                separate from everything else. It's position is anchored by it's closest statically positioned ancestor, and
                is controlled with the CSS properties <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>right</code>.
                You can also use <code>z-index</code> to control its position in a z axis, which can be affected by the opacity
                if it overlaps other elements.                
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>position:&nbsp;fixed;</code></td>
              <td>
                Similar to <code>absolute</code> positioning, except the element is positioned relative to the browser viewport
                itself (as opposed to its closest static ancestor).
              </td>
            </tr> 
            <tr>
              <td><code>position:&nbsp;sticky;</code></td>
              <td>
                An experimental position that is not yet widely supported, it is a hybrid of relative and fixed. The element is
                relatively positioned until it is scrolled to a certain threshold point, after which it becomes fixed.

        <td>Flexbox</td>
        <td>
          A new technology, but with support now fairly widespread across browsers, Flexbox is starting to become ready for
          widespread use. It allows for rapid creation of complex, flexible layouts, and features that have historically proved
          difficult with CSS.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Grids</td>
        <td>
          A nascent new browser feature that makes implementing a grid design much easier. Grid designs, such as those popularized
          by Bootstrap and other similar CSS toolkits have traditionally used <code>floats</code> or other layout features, and
          can sometimes prove tricky to implement.
