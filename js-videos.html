      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Doug puts the JavaScript programming language in its proper historical context, tracing the language's structure and conventions (and some of its quirks)
        back to their roots in the early decades of computer science.

      <summary>Scene 6: Loopage</summary>
      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Software development is hampered by a specific set of design mistakes that were made in the first programming languages and repeated in everything
        that has been done since. And, somewhat miraculously, JavaScript is going to make it right, radically transforming the way we write applications.
        Again. In the Loop of History, it has all happened before, but it has never happened like this. This is why you should care about the emergence of
        server-side JavaScript and the excitement around projects like Node.js -- not because they're at the sharp end of a trend, but because they're paving
        the road toward the next big revolution in software.

      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        In this keynote talk from YUIConf 2011, Doug drops some science to explain why code style is important in programming -- particularly in JavaScript --
        and how tools like JSLint can help.
