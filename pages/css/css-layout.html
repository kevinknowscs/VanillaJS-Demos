                    <p>
                      This page reviews the basic CSS layout strategies that a web developer can employ
                      to layout content on a page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Along the way I present a basic workflow for how one can go about translating a desired design
                      into a workable page layout. First, we start by creating a sensible DOM layout using standard
                      HTML tags and/or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags. Next, we work on the
                      general sizing and spacing of the layout using the CSS Box Model facilities. Before going any further,
                      we pause to think about how the layout will work with different screen sizes, and think about how we
                      will use CSS Media Queries to affect a responsive design. We then consider when or where we may need
                      to use floats or positioning. Finally, we consider which type of layout will be most effective for our
                      design by considering table, list, Flexbox, and Grid layout mechanisms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That's not to suggest that the workflow is a strictly linear progress. For example, if one knows for
                      sure that they want or need a Flexbox or Grid layout, you may want to start there and then work your
                      way back into the CSS Box Model margins and padding. It's an iterative process. The final design will
                      usually involve a hybrid of all of the approaches outlined here.

                    <p>
                      Before we begin to stylize and layout the page structure with CSS rules, we want to first consider
                      a sensible DOM structure using available HTML tags.
                    </p>
                    <table class="common">
                      <tr>
                        <th>Tag Section(s)</th>
                        <th>Purpose</th>
                        <th>Tag List</th>
                        <th>Notes</th>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Phrasing Content</td>
                        <td>Presentation-Oriented Inline Content Styling</td>
                        <td><code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code></td>
                        <td>
                          Avoid using presentation-oriented tags. Use alternate tags with better semantic
                          meaning where possible. <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is preferred over <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>.
                          <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is preferred over <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>. Use paragraphs and/or margins
                          and padding in place of <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> where possible.

                          Most other tags not listed here, with the exception of metadata tags, are part of a large category
                          of flow content tags. They are generally used to style the actual content of the page, not the
                          structural layout.

                          Sectioning content tags are the first opportunity to begin considering the actual structural layout
                          of the page.
                        </td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Flow Content</td>

                        <td>
                          Technically speaking, these tags are flow content, and are not considered part of sectioning content
                          or heading content. They are generally placed inside of a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, but this is not
                          required. When not inside a section group, the tags should be considered to supply header and footer content
                          for the page body. As such, these tags should be considered for use as part of an overall page
                          layout strategy.

                        <td>
                          Another flow content tag, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> designates the main body of content of page.
                          It should not contain any content that is repeated across pages, such as logos, top navigation bars, side
                          navigation bars, headers, footers, etc. This tag should be considered as part of a well-designed page layout.

                        <td>
                          Use heading content tags to supply title information to pages and sections.

                        <td>Lists &amp; More</td>
                        <td>
                          <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          Traditionally used to format hierarchically-arranged bulleted lists, these tags have
                          been used creatively for other purposes. A common example is to use a formatted list to style
                          a set of tab header items for tab-separated content. In addition to the tags, the CSS property
                          <code>display:&nbsp;list&#8209;item</code> can be used to style any element as a list item.
                        </td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Flow Content</td>
                        <td>Tables</td>
                        <td>
                          <code>&lt;table&gt;<code>, <code>&lt;tr&gt;<code>, <code>&lt;thead&gt;<code>, <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;<code>,
                          <code>&lt;th&gt;<code>, <code>&lt;td&gt;<code>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          Tables should not be used for general page layout purposes. They should only be used to format genuinely
                          tabular data for which multiply aligned rows and columns are the most logical form of presentation. The
                          corresponding CSS rules <code>display:&nbsp;table</code> and its brethren can now be used to style any
                          element as a table-type structure, and can sometimes be a good choice for cetain layouts that are difficult
                          to achieve with ordinary methods, although now with Flexbox and Grid layouts they are less needed.
                        </td>

                        <td>
                          Because HTML provides us with so few sectioning content tags that we can use for semantically-meaningful
                          layout, most of the time we need to resort the the generic box tags <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and
                          <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, which provide block and inline boxes (see below for more details).
                          For increased semantic meaning, we can apply one or more CSS classes.

                      they can be applied to any element. These properties are frequently the first line of attack when approaching

                    <p>
                      After laying out the page with well-chosen HTML tags, and choosing <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code>,
                      and <code>inline&#8209;block</code> box types as-needed, the next step in a typical layout workflow would
                      be to turn our attention to the CSS Box Model styling attributes to size the boxes as we'd like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The CSS Box Model is a very power and flexible mechanism for controlling the margin, border, and padding of
                      the boxes.

                        <td>
                          <p>
                           The <code>box&#8209;sizing</code> property is set to <code>content&#8209;box</code> by default. That means
                           the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> settings are applied to the size of the box's content only.
                           The total size of the box is the content size + border + margin + padding.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            It's often the case, especially when focusing on the outer, overall layout of the page, that this doesn't
                            give us what we want. If we change the sizing property to <code>border&#8209;box</code>, then the height
                            and width will apply to the content size + padding + border (but still not the margin).

                          <p>
                            Although not immediately obvious, negative margins are valid on boxes. While its best not to misuse this
                            feature, there are legitimate use cases for negative margins. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/the-definitive-guide-to-using-negative-margins/">More Details</a>

                        <td>
                          <p>
                            The keyword <code>auto</code> can be applied as a setting to the left and right margins. When they are both
                            set to <code>auto</code>, then content will center itself horizontally with the parent box.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Unfortunately, <code>auto</code> margins do not work for the top and bottom margins, and so the same technique
                            does not work for vertically aligning content within a parent box. Vertical alignment is a classic problem with
                            HTML and CSS.

                        <td>CSS <code>calc()</code> Function</td>
                        <td>
                          <p>
                            The introduction of CSS3 gave us the <code>calc()</code> function, which is now supported on all modern browsers,
                            including IE10 and IE11, and even IE9 supports it with a few minor bugs.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The most common use case is to calculate the actual width based on a percentage value and a fixed unit value. For example,
                            suppose my box has left and right margins of 10px each, and I want my width to be 100% of the width of my parent. Without
                            <code>calc()</code>, I have no way to do this. Even if I set <code>box&#8209;sizing:&nbsp;border&#8209;box</code>, I still
                            have to account for my margins. Using <code>calc()</code> I can subract off my left and right margins and set
                            <code>width:&nbsp;calc(100%&nbsp;-&nbsp;20px)</code>.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The <code>calc()</code> function works best when I have the box sizing set to <code>border&#8209;box</code>, because then
                            I only need to worry about my margins. The padding and borders are already accounted for.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The <code>calc()</code> function is less needed now that we have the newer Flexbox and Grid layouts. Even so, I find that
                            this is often the easiest way of accomplishing some otherwise thorny layout problems.

                        <td>Setting Body Height</td>
                        <td>
                          <p>
                            It doesn't happen to me as much anymore, but when I was new to CSS layout I'd often get burned by this one. I'd have a layout
                            that I intended to fill the full page of the browser. I was certain everything was correct, but my inner child element wouldn't
                            expand to fill the full height of the browser. Instead, it would collapse down to the height of its children.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The problem is that the html and body tags themselves were not expanding to the full browser height. We can set those easily
                            enough. I also usually set padding and margin to 0 on those element as well. My CSS generally has a rule it it like:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <code>
                              html, body {<br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;0;<br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;padding:&nbsp;0;<br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;100%;<br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;100%;<br>
                              }
                            </code>
                          </p>
                        </td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Other Display Types</td>
                        <td>
                          In the old days of CSS 2.1, we only had the lowly <code>display:&nbsp;block</code> and <code>display:&nbsp;inline</code> to
                          work with. But with the introduction of CSS 3, we gained a whole host of new display options. We now have display types
                          dedicated to list and table displays, and with the new Flexbox and Grid layout modules, we've gained even more flexibility.

                    <summary>Media Queries</summary>
                    <p>
                      Media queries allow us to design interfaces that are responsive to a wide variety of device capabilities. Our page layouts
                      should contemplate how the user experience will behave on different screen sizes and different device capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Originally introduced as <em>media types</em> in CSS 2, which provided some limited responsive design constructs, these
                      capabilities were greatly expanded in CSS 3 with the introduction of <em>media queries</em>. CSS 2 only allowed us to query
                      the type of the device, but with CSS 3 we can query the <em><strong>capabilities</strong></em> of the device. Does the
                      device have a mouse? Does it support stylus or touch input? What is its aspect ratio? Etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some measure of responsive design can be accomplished without media queries. When we use percentage height and widths in
                      our CSS rules, telling the browser to stretch out our content to fill the space of the parent box, we're doing responsive
                      design that can accommodate the user resizing their browser ... but only to a degree. That approach won't accommodate radical
                      changes in screen size. What happens if the user accesses the site from their smartphone or tablet? It won't look good.
                      We need more than just stretching our box to fill the space, we need a way to choose between entirely different layout options
                      based on the capabilities of the device. Our beautiful side navigation pane looks great when the browser is at least 1200px
                      wide, but for smaller sizes we want a dropdown list at the top of the page that doesn't require as much space. Those are the
                      kinds of choices we can build into our CSS rules using media queries.
                    </p>

                    <summary>Floats</summary>
                    <p>
                      Originally designed for floating blocks of text around images, the <code>float</code> property became, prior
                      to Flexbox and Grid layouts, one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on web pages.
                      Another common use case is laying out a top navigation bar. You want some content in the navigation bar aligned to
                      the left hand side, and other content aligned to the right hand side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Floats are tricky to use, because after using the float to align the desired content, we need to clear
                      the floats so that the follow-on content goes back normal. This makes the designing clean, well-organized,
                      independently-formatted content more difficult. Floats are less needed now that we have Flexbox and Grid layouts,
                      but they can still be useful in some situations.

                      differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside
                      the browser viewport.

                        <td><code>position:&nbsp;static;</code></td>
                        <td>
                          The default position of every element. It means <q>put the element in it's normal position in the
                          document layout flow.</q>

                        <td>
                          Once the positioned element has taken its place in the normal layout flow, you can then
                          modify its final position (using the CSS properties <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>,
                          and <code>right</code>).

                          An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. It sits on it's own layer,
                          separate from everything else. It's position is anchored by it's closest statically positioned ancestor, and
                          is controlled with the CSS properties <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>right</code>.
                          You can also use <code>z-index</code> to control its position in a z axis, which can be affected by the opacity
                          if it overlaps other elements.

                        <td>
                          Similar to <code>absolute</code> positioning, except the element is positioned relative to the browser viewport
                          itself (as opposed to its closest static ancestor).
                        </td>

                        <td>
                          An experimental position that is not yet widely supported, it is a hybrid of relative and fixed. The element is
                          relatively positioned until it is scrolled to a certain threshold point, after which it becomes fixed.

                    <p>
                      Using the HTML table tags for layout purposes has always been frowned upon, primarily
                      <a href="http://phrogz.net/css/WhyTablesAreBadForLayout.html" target="_blank">for these reasons</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The dogma always seemed a bit silly to me, especially considering how difficult is was to create certain layouts
                      without tables, and how easy it was to do with tables. Take for example the so-called
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design)" target="_blank">Holy Grail</a> layout, and various
                      attempts over the years to create them with tableless CSS rules. It hardly seems fair to give something the mystique
                      of the <em><strong>Holy Grail</strong></em>, when there's a beautiful, solid gold, jewel-encrusted chalice laid out
                      directly before you, surrounded by flashing neon lights emblazened with the headline <q>Jesus Drank from this Cup</q>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But, using CSS tables instead of hard-coded HTML elements, we can avoid some of the downsides of tables. With Flexbox
                      now becoming ubiquitous, there's less reason to consider CSS tables, but even so, it's good to keep CSS table layout
                      tucked away in your bag of tricks. Any HTML element can be made to act as a table element using the CSS <code>display</code>
                      property.

                      A new technology, but with support now fairly widespread across browsers, Flexbox is starting to become ready for
                      widespread use. It allows for rapid creation of complex, flexible layouts, and features that have historically proved
                      difficult with CSS.

                    <p>
                      A nascent new browser feature that makes implementing a grid design much easier. Grid designs, such as those popularized
                      by Bootstrap and other similar CSS toolkits have traditionally used <code>floats</code> or other layout features, and
                      can sometimes prove tricky to implement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The main difference between Flexbox and Grid is that Flexbox is designed for a one-dimensional layout,
                      whereas Grid is explicitly designed to create two-dimensional layouts.
