                      Architected a major redesign of the Web UI for <strong>Visual Uptime</strong>, a high-availability network monitoring system
                      for major service providers such as AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. I led an international team to update legacy
                      code to a modular architecture of the UI and charting components in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The redesign
                      is testable with modern design patterns to allow team members to quickly react to new requirements, resulting
                      in recurring, high gross margin revenue of over $75 million.

                      Planned and implemented the data migration strategy for <strong>TruView</strong> from SQL Server to Mongo DB, ElasticSearch,
                      and Cassandra to allow the customers to use an open platform with high-throughput data capture needed to
                      support 10Gb network monitoring.

                    <p>
                      In addition, I developed the automated provisioning system for ElasticSearch clusters to allow customers to
                      easily expand their TruView deployment to support ultra-high-performance network monitoring.

                      Created <strong>BuildBeat</strong>, a pioneering continuous integration system (pre-dated Jenkins and Bamboo) that used a multi-agent
                      architecture to distribute build jobs onto different servers to execute tasks in parallel for best performance. The
                      architecture utilized proper design patterns and best practices, including an asynchronous messaging library for
                      communication among build agents, a service bus that coordinated worker classes, and an object/relational mapping system
                      for database access. The front-end was written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript with ASP.NET Web Forms, the back-end in C#,
                      with SQL Server and MySQL databases for persistence.

                    <p>
                      Designed and implemented <strong>MergeMagician</strong>, a system for managing the workflow of automated, server-side merges in a
                      heavily-branched version control system. It is somewhat analogous to GitHub pull requests, but more advanced as it would cascade
                      merges up and down the branch hierarchy using a publish/subscribe configuration model to perform merges automatically. It utilized
                      a pluggable component architecture for supporting multiple version control systems.

                    <p>
                      Conceived and implemented <strong>LotsOfJots</strong>, a cloud-based document management system that combines elements of note-taking systems,
                      semantic wikis, and document portals. The goal was to create a easy to use documentation system with reusable content,
                      topic-based authoring, improved readability, fluid navigation across multi-sectioned documents, and fast searching. The
                      system is scalable, using MongoDb for document storage, ElasticSearch for indexed searching, and is hosted on Microsoft Azure.

                    <p>
                      Developed a graphical reporting package for JDSU’s automated testing system that allowed managers to make informed decisions
                      regarding product readiness. The Web UI used Raphael to render various chart types such as bar and spider charts, while the server
                      side was C# with Entity Framework accessing a MS SQL Server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Designed and developed a mapper component for an enterprise application integration (EAI) product, a critical component used
                      to visually correlate input fields to output fields. The component allowed customers to easily create ETL pipelines without
                      resorting to complex scripting. Development utilized JavaScript, SVG, jQuery, jQuery UI, and Backbone with a focus on UX/UI
                      and collaborated with back-end engineers to refine the Web API.

                      Designed and architected <strong>TeamTrack</strong>, one of the first web-based issue tracking systems on the market. The system built upon my
                      prior defect tracking experience, adding support for multiple projects, cross-project reporting, state-based workflow,
                      application-specific user privileges, an integrated scripting language, and graphical trend reports for management insights.
                      The system was written in C++, ran on Microsoft IIS using the ISAPI interface, and supported multiple database systems such
                      as Oracle, SQL Server, and Microsoft Access.

                      Software Edge, makers of <strong>Defect Control System</strong>, later known as PVCS Tracker, was an early pioneer in the
                      field of defect tracking, creating the first ever defect tracking system to run on the Microsoft Windows platform.

                      As a co-founder of the company, I established the technical direction of the product and test strategies,
                      as well as coordinated technical writers and support engineers.  In addition, I was actively involved in
                      implementation, creating a customizable content rendering system, and leading the project team to port
                      the system to run on SQL Server and Oracle. The company experienced rapid adoption and received numerous
                      industry awards.  It was aquired by INTERSOLV where the product became part of the PVCS suite.
